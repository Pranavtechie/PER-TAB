# PER-TAB
PER TAB the name derived from the <u>per<u>iodic <u>tab<u>le, as you thought this software is about Periodic Table and its representation of the Elements.

In this appilication we have a activity as well. 
Acitivity is very simple- You just have to enter your name and you will find all the elements possible with your name in two Sub-Divisions i.e. 
  1) Elements having only one character in their Symbol.
  2) Elements having only two characters in their Symbol. 
  
  
We have all the elements listed in format of the Modern Periodic Table you can check the properties of the element just by clicking on the element box.
Hold your horses before jumping right into the data of the element first you have to read a random fact out of 102 facts in our sqlite3 database and then you are 
free to check out the data of a element. 

Wait...
It's not complete yet there is a one more hidden easter egg I hope it should not be called like that but, You can check it out?
Just click on the heading in the Main Window i.e. that is the heading which reads "The Modern Periodic Table", you will find yourself in 
a pdf containing all the uses of the periodic table in a pdf format.

That's it what I have dome for this version. I hope develop more aspects of it in future...
